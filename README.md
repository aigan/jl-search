# <JL-SEARCH> element
Incremental search and select with autocomplete as a flexible web component

Modern buildless element with no dependencies, for incremental search with
inline autocomplete. It support both imperative and declarative rendering.
Supports both light and shadowdom. Use a default style or make your own. Embed
or subclass. Create any type of search result list. I provide examples for
plain javascript, shadowdom and usage with Lit-element.
