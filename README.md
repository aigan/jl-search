# <JL-SEARCH> element
Incremental search and select with autocomplete as a flexible web component

Modern buildless element for incremental search with autocomplete, with
support for both imperative and declarative rendering. Supports both light and
shadowdom. Use a default style or make your own. Embed or subclass. Create any
type of search result list. I provide examples for plain javascript, shadowdom
and usage with Lit-element.
